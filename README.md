🛠 Built With

    React

    React Router

    Tailwind CSS

    Vite

🧠 Motivation

This project was created on Day 11 of my React learning journey to build clean, accessible, and responsive navigation — just like you'd see in real-world UK tech projects (BBC, Monzo, GOV.UK).

## ♿️ Accessibility

This project includes accessibility improvements such as:
- `:focus-visible` styles for keyboard users
- Semantic HTML elements (`<main>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`)
- Proper use of `aria-current` for navigation

Following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines improves usability and aligns with UK digital service standards.
